const dataDemographic = d3.json(url);

Using d3.json(url) to fetch data from the specified URL and assigns the returned promise to the dataDemographic variable. Then, it logs a message to the console, printing the value of dataDemographic.

However, it's important to note that d3.json(url) returns a promise, not the actual data. The data is asynchronously loaded, so when you log dataDemographic immediately after calling d3.json(url), it will show a pending promise object rather than the actual data.

To access the actual data, you need to use a .then() method or async/await syntax to handle the promise.

## Bar Chart Function
The barChart function described in the provided code snippet generates a horizontal bar chart using data retrieved from a JSON file specified by the url variable.

The barChart function accepts a testId parameter, which represents the ID of the test or sample for which the bar chart is generated.

It uses d3.json(url) to fetch the JSON data from the specified URL. The data is then accessed within the .then() method.

The retrieved data is logged to the console using console.log(data) for debugging or verification purposes.

The code finds the relevant samples and metadata for the given testId using the Array.prototype.find() method. The samples variable will contain the sample values, and the metadataNames variable will contain the metadata information.

The necessary data for the bar chart is extracted from the samples, including the values, OTU IDs, and OTU labels.

The top 10 values and corresponding IDs are selected by using the Array.prototype.slice() method and reversing the order using Array.prototype.reverse().

The y_label array is created by prefixing each OTU ID with the string "OTU" using Array.prototype.map().

The bardata object is created, which contains the x and y data for the bar chart, the chart type ('bar'), and the orientation ('h' for horizontal).

The layout object is defined with a title for the bar chart.

Finally, the Plotly.newPlot() function is used to create the bar chart with the provided data and layout. The chart is rendered in an HTML element with the ID "bar".

## Bubble chart function
Here's a breakdown of the code:

The code uses d3.json(url) to fetch the JSON data from the specified URL. The retrieved data is then accessed within the .then() method.

The data is logged to the console using console.log(data) for debugging or verification purposes.

The necessary data for the bubble chart is extracted from the samples object within the data. Specifically, the sample_values, otu_ids, and otu_labels are assigned to separate variables.

The y_data variable is set to the sample values, and the x_data variable is set to the OTU IDs.

The bubbledata object is created, which contains the x and y data for the bubble chart, the chart mode ('markers'), and the marker properties such as size, colorscale, color, and text. These properties determine the appearance of the bubbles in the chart.

The layout object is defined with a title for the bubble chart and an x-axis title.

Finally, the Plotly.newPlot() function is used to create the bubble chart with the provided data and layout. The chart is rendered in an HTML element with the ID "bubble".

By executing this code, a bubble chart will be generated using the data retrieved from the JSON file, with the sample values plotted on the y-axis, the OTU IDs on the x-axis, and the bubbles representing the data points.





## Demographic function
The changeDemogInfo function retrieves JSON data from the specified URL and updates the demographic information based on the selected ID. Here's an overview of the function:

The d3.json(url) method is used to fetch the JSON data from the URL. The retrieved data is accessed within the .then() method.

The retrieved data is logged to the console using console.log(data) for debugging or verification purposes.

The indexId variable is assigned the index of the newId in the names array of the data. This index is used to access the corresponding metadata for the selected ID.

The existing content in the #sample-metadata element is cleared using d3.select("#sample-metadata").html("").

The function iterates over the key-value pairs of the metadata for the selected indexId using a for...of loop with Object.entries(). Within the loop, a new <div> element is appended to the #sample-metadata element, displaying each key-value pair as text content.

The d3.json(url) method is called again to retrieve the latest data.

The dropdown options in the #selDataset element are updated with the latest data.names. The .selectAll().data().join().text() method chain is used to bind the data to the options and set the text content of each option.

By executing this code, the demographic information displayed in the #sample-metadata element will be updated based on the selected ID, and the dropdown options in the #selDataset element will be updated with the latest data names.

## on Change function
// Function to handle option change event
function optionChanged(newValue) {
  barChart(newValue);          // Update the bar chart with the new value
  bubbleChart(newValue);       // Update the bubble chart with the new value
  changeDemogInfo(newValue);    // Update the demographic information with the new value
};

This code contains functions to handle the option change event and update various visualizations and information based on the selected option.

- `optionChanged(newValue)`: This function is triggered when the option is changed in the dropdown menu. It takes the new value as the `newValue` parameter. It calls the following functions with the new value:
    - `barChart(newValue)`: Updates the bar chart with the new value.
    - `bubbleChart(newValue)`: Updates the bubble chart with the new value.
    - `changeDemogInfo(newValue)`: Updates the demographic information with the new value.

To initialize the page and set the initial visualization and information, you may call the `optionChanged` function with the default or initial value.
